# Becoming a Data Scientist


## Step 0: Basics of R / Python

a) [Learning Path on R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-r-data-science/): Step 0 to Step 2

b) [Learning Path on Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/): Step 0 to Step 2


## Step 1: Learn basic Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

1. [descriptive statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud827)

2. [Inferential statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud201)

3. Tools:

R: [Stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html)

Python: [Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/), [Numpy](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial), [Pandas](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)

## Step 2: Data Exploration / Cleaning / Preparation

The more quality time you spend here, the better it is.

Exercise / assignment:

1. Take up the titanic survival problem from Kaggle, build a set of hypothesis and then clean the data, add new features to the existing dataset. Think what is the best way to impute missing age?

2. Similarly, take up the Bike sharing demand forecasting problem and repeat the cycle mentioned above.

## Step 3: Introduction to Machine Learning

1. Option 1: If you are some one who likes to take learning in small small steps and need more hand holding, you should start from [Machine learning course from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

2. Option 2: If you are more independent, like challenges and can battle out tough assignments, you should take [Learning form Data course by Prof. Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)

You can refer learning path (step-6 ) of [R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-r-data-science/)(additionally, [ML Algorithms in R](http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-get-started-with-machine-learning-algorithms-in-r/)) and [Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/) to explore about these packages and related options.

## Step 4: Participate in Kaggle Knowledge competition
